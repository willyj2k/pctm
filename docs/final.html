    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>In this project, we parsed .ply files in order to get 3D vertices or our point cloud. Using these vertices, we
        calculated the normals. To calculate the vertex normals, we took advantage of the already calculated spatial
        mapping that will be used for the ball pivot algorithm. With spatial mapping, we were able to calculate the
        centroid of every vertex closeby and calculated a vector from the centroid to the vertex in question. The
        “normal” was then simply the direction of that vector, and we updated the normal attribute in each vertex. Then,
        with the point cloud and normals we implemented the ball-pivoting algorithm in order to create a 3D mesh.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Technical Approach</h2>

    <h3>Parsing .ply Files</h3>
    <p>To parse .ply files, our group decided to utilize the rply library. Using this library, parsing each line in the
        .ply file for vertex positions became rather straightforward, and we were able to successfully extract a list of
        Vector3D vertices from passed in ply files. To render .ply files, we took advantage of the already existing
        rendering code inside meshEdit.cpp from project 2. Our group decided to not utilize the halfedge data structure
        though, and as a result, a majority of the code in meshEdit was unused. However, we were able to follow some of
        the rendering patterns from the file, and were able to successfully render points and edges from our algorithm
        results. Unfortunately, our group was unable to figure out the opengl shader program, and as such our renderings
        only came out in a single color.
    </p>

    <h3>Ball Pivoting Algorithm</h3>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>We followed the algorithm detailed in the research paper: The Ball-Pivoting Algorithm for Surface Reconstruction.
        The pseudocode given for this algorithm required us to write separate helper functions such as
        find_seed_triangle, ball_pivot, join, and glue.</p>

    <div align="center">
        <img src="images/final/ballpivot.png" align="middle" width="480px"/>
    </div>
    <p>The above picture shows an example of how the ball-pivot algorithm works. With a seed triangle where a 3D ball is
        resting on all three points, the ball pivots over an edge eij until it touches another point vertex k. The new
        triangle ijk is stored to be rendered after the algorithm is complete, and from that new position, the center of
        the sphere is calculated and the ball continues to pivot over the new edges ik and kj.</p>

    <h4>Data Structures</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><p><b>Point: </b> Our point class stores a point position and its normal.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>PivotTriangle: </b> This struct was added into our BallPivot class in order to store the 3 points
            associated with a triangle. It also stores information about an edge from the point sigma_i to sigma_j. This
            way, we can calculate the position of the ball as it pivots around a certain pivot edge.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>Front: </b> A front is essentially a list of active edge loops that will be used to keep track of
            growing faces on the resulting mesh. In our code, this is represented as a vector of vectors of PivotEdges,
            where edges are popped or pushed back based on the removal and addition of edges in the ball pivot
            algorithm.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Spatial Mapping</h4>
    <p>Given a list of points, we created a spatial map for these points in order to speed up the process of finding the
        seed triangle. Each 3D box had a height, width, and depth of 2 * (radius of the sphere). The hash position and
        create spatial grid functions were similar to our project 4 clothsim's spatial mapping functions.</p>

    <h4>Find Seed Triangle</h4>
    <p>The first step in the ball-pivoting algorithm is to identify a "seed" from which to begin the pivoting action.
        Naturally, to begin the search for candidates we iterate over points using the spatial map described in the
        previous section. We also take an advantage of an optimization mentioned in our reference paper, where we only
        consider one candiate seed triangle per spatial partition. This scheme allows us to avoid constructing
        artifacts from noise and only "catch" components that span a volume greater than a few partitions. Therefore,
        to find a seed, we keep track of partitions containing no elements of the constructed mesh, and search over
        said partitions until no more remain. Additionally, because the algorithm simulates a ball rolling along the
        surface of the mesh, we search over points in order of descending dot product with the average normal of the
        partition. This heuristic allows us to more reliably seed the ball "on" the surface, so that we're ready to
        roll.</p>

    <p>Then, after identifying the first candidate point using the scheme above, we iterate over pairs of points in a
        2&rho;-neighborhood in order of increasing distance, where &rho; is the radius of the ball. Then, among these
        points, we check whether the triplet of points forms a valid triangle (i.e., their normals are aligned and
        there exists a ball of radius &rho; that touches all three points and contains no other point). If so, then a
        valid seed triangle has been identified and we return it.</p>

    <h4>Ball Pivot</h4>
    <p>In this part, we simulate the ball rolling along the surface to identify new points of the mesh. In particular,
        we simulate the ball rotating outward from the surface from its initial position, about the axis defined by the
        pivoting edge (the edge around which we're rolling). During this motion, we want to find the first point that
        the ball hits (with a valid normal); then this new point along with the pivoting edge form a new triangle with
        edges from which we can continue pivoting.</p>

    <p>Of course, in practice it would be inefficient (and potentially inaccurate) to actually simulate the rolling
        motion of the ball, so instead we search over all points that could potentially be hit by the rolling ball and
        analytically solve for the angle of rotation along the ball's trajectory that each candidate point is hit. Then,
        we simply take the argmin of these angles.</p>

    <h4>Join</h4>
    <p>To generate triangles from the ball pivot algorithm, we utilized two helper methods to add and remove edges to a
        growing list of edge loops. To add edges, we used a helper method called join, which adds two edges eik and ekj
        connecting an unused vertex vk touched by the ball in the ball pivot algorithm when pivoting on an active edge
        eij. The resulting triangle is stored in an external list that keeps track of every triangle we will render at
        the end of the algorithm, and the edge eij is removed from the front and eik and ekj are added to the front to
        be expanded upon later. If the vertex vk is actually already used, then that means the vertex is either inside
        the mesh, which means the edge eij should be marked as a boundary edge, or the vertex vk is already in the front
        and we need to remove potentially repeating active edges in the front. This removal of extra edges is taken care
        of in the second helper function glue().</p>

    <h4>Glue</h4>
    <p>The glue function serves to remove any extraneous edges created by the join function above, essentially “gluing”
        the edges together and removing sub-loops that could be formed in the front. To check for this, glue takes in a
        newly created edge eij and checks the loops in the front for the existence of any opposing edges eji. According
        to the paper, there are four possible scenarios if an opposing edge eji exists and four different ways to handle
        each scenario. In the first scenario, the opposing edge eji and eij are the only two edges in the loop. If this
        happens, we know that eij has already been checked and thus both edges can be removed from the front and the
        loop is deleted. In the second scenario, both edges belong to the same loop and are adjacent to each other. If
        this occurs, we simply remove the sub-loop created by the opposing edges and the loop in the front is therefore
        shortened. In the third scenario, both edges belong to the same loop, but are not adjacent to each other. In
        this situation, we remove the loop created by the opposing edges and split the original loop into two. In the
        fourth scenario, the edges do not belong to the same loop, and we must then connect both loops into one. To do
        this, we take the beginning of loop1 and connect that to the end of loop2 and vice versa, deleting the sub-loop
        created by the opposing edges. After running glue, any opposing edges will be removed from the front to prevent
        any repeating active edges, and the algorithm can proceed as usual.</p>

    <h3>Problems</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rendering was a big challenge in this project. Initially we had relied on the existing code from MeshEdit to
            render our mesh, but we realized that the halfedge data structure was heavily relied upon and we had chosen
            to avoid using halfedges in our final design schema. Thus, the rendering for our vertex normals and
            resulting mesh had to be done from scratch. Unfortunately, our group was unable to completely figure out the
            shaders and difficult rendering syntax used by C++ and chose to prioritize completing our algorithm instead.
            As such, our results were all in grayscale and have no sense of depth, but we felt that our time was better
            spent on finishing our algorithm.
        </li>
        <li>The concept of the algorithm didn't seem very daunting at first, but it turned out that the reference paper
            somewhat glossed over many of the mathematical details of the implementation (unlike the specifications for
            the class projects!). Consequently, it took us much more time than expected to sort these out (for example,
            searching the interet for solution methods and convincing ourselves that results we found were indeed
            correct!).
        </li>
        <li>As with any other somewhat sizeable coding project, the choice of initial design (data structures, classes,
            etc.) is decisive in determining the complexity of programming the algorithm. Unfortunately, we apparently
            didn't have a solid enough understanding of the algorithm and its specifics initially, and began the
            project with code that we would mostly end up entirely rewriting later on.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Using C++ was not that great. We thought we could use our meshedit project to render, but the Halfedge data
            structure overcomplicated the rendering so we had to create our own draw function. In the future, we would
            use Python or Java to simplify our codebase and make navigating files easier.
        </li>
    </ul>
